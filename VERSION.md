*(for `0.0.0-pre-alpha.1`)*

## Pre-Alpha 1 (`0.0.0-pre-alpha.1`)

**Release Type:** Pre-Alpha
**Audience:** Author, early readers, philosophical reviewers
**Stability:** Experimental (no backward-compatibility guarantees)

------

## Purpose of This Version

Pre-Alpha 1 represents the **initial articulation** of The System.

This version exists to capture the first complete expression of the ontology as it was originally conceived, prior to later clarification, refinement, or constraint. It establishes the foundational concepts, terminology, and motivating questions that would guide subsequent drafts.

Documentation for this version is **retroactively generated** and reflects the state of understanding achieved after the fact.

------

## Primary Artifact

This version is defined entirely by the following document:

- `artifacts/The_System_Pre_Alpha_Spec.md`

No additional architectural, abstract, or contribution documentation was present at the time of this draft.

------

## Characteristics

- Conceptual exploration without formalized constraints
- Terminology not yet stabilized
- Ontological boundaries implicit rather than explicit
- No defined release or versioning discipline at time of writing

These characteristics are accepted and expected for an initial pre-alpha draft.

------

## Known Limitations (Accepted for Pre-Alpha)

- No separation between narrative explanation and architectural observation
- No explicit articulation of non-promises or non-goals
- No defined contribution or licensing posture
- No canonical distinction between observation, action, and record

------

## Compatibility Notes

- This version is **not compatible** with later drafts in any strict sense
- It should be treated as a historical conceptual snapshot
- It is preserved for lineage and reference, not for extension

------

## Closing Note

Pre-Alpha 1 is best understood as a **foundational thought document**.

It captures the moment The System first cohered as an idea, before its internal constraints, limits, and intentional omissions were made explicit.
