# VERSION.md

## Pre-Alpha 3 (`0.0.0-pre-alpha.3`)

**Release Type:** Pre-Alpha
**Audience:** Early readers, theorists, implementors, and designers evaluating the ontology
**Stability:** Experimental (no backward-compatibility guarantees)

---

## Purpose of This Version

This version represents a **conceptual consolidation milestone**.

Pre-Alpha 3 exists to:

* Clarify the ontological intent of The System
* Correct over-interpretations that implied guarantees, preservation, or authority
* Establish precise language around **observation**, **transmutation**, **agency**, and **co-observation**
* Provide a stable narrative and architectural reference point for future drafts

This version is not feature-complete in an implementation sense, but is **internally coherent** in its conceptual framing.

---

## Documentation

The following documents are authoritative for this version:

* `docs/ABSTRACT.md`
  Refined narrative articulation of intent, origin, and purpose, emphasizing *observed knowledge*, co-observation, and perceptive discipline without over-claiming outcomes.

* `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  Formal design observations describing the non-totalizing, non-coercive, externally governed ontology of The System.

* `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`
  Contribution posture and licensing intent, clarifying forks, adapters, extensions, and the rarity of direct core changes.

* `docs/VERSIONING.md`
  Canonical definition of lifecycle phases and semantic versioning rules.

* `docs/RELEASING.md`
  Release discipline and invariants governing tagged versions.

---

## Scope Clarifications Introduced in This Version

This version explicitly establishes that:

* The System does **not** guarantee documentation, preservation, accuracy, or truth
* The System does **not** assign or preserve semantics such as quality or veracity
* Observation and Transmutation are the only fundamental actions
* Any semantics beyond representation must be supplied explicitly by an Alchemist
* Guarantees, validation, or enforcement are matters of extension, not ontology

These clarifications correct ambiguities present in earlier drafts.

---

## Known Limitations (Accepted for Pre-Alpha)

* The ontology is descriptive, not executable
* No formal glossary is yet canonical
* No reference implementation is provided
* Terminology may continue to be refined in subsequent pre-alpha drafts
* No guarantees are made regarding future structural continuity

These limitations are intentional and consistent with the Pre-Alpha phase.

---

## Compatibility Notes

* This release is additive in clarification, but **not guaranteed backward-compatible**
* Future Pre-Alpha versions may revise terminology, structure, or emphasis
* This version should be treated as an immutable conceptual snapshot
* Intended for evaluation and exploration, not prescriptive of outcomes

---

## Closing Note

Pre-Alpha 3 marks the point at which The System’s **intent, constraints, and non-promises** are explicitly stated rather than implied.

Subsequent versions may expand, refine, or restructure the ontology, but this version serves as a stable reference for understanding *what The System is—and what it deliberately is not*.
