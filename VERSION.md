*(for `0.0.0-pre-alpha.2`)*

## Pre-Alpha 2 (`0.0.0-pre-alpha.2`)

**Release Type:** Pre-Alpha
**Audience:** Early readers, theorists, and prospective implementors
**Stability:** Experimental (no backward-compatibility guarantees)

------

## Purpose of This Version

Pre-Alpha 2 represents the **first substantive refinement** of The System.

This version builds upon the initial specification by expanding, correcting, and re-articulating core ideas that were implicit or underdefined in Pre-Alpha 1. It reflects deeper engagement with the consequences of observation, agency, and representation.

As with Pre-Alpha 1, documentation for this version is **retroactively generated**.

------

## Primary Artifacts

This version is defined by the following documents:

- `artifacts/The_System_Pre_Alpha_Spec.md`
- `artifacts/The_System_Pre_Alpha_Spec_2.md`

Together, these documents represent the complete conceptual state of The System at this stage.

------

## Advancements Over Pre-Alpha 1

Compared to the initial draft, this version:

- Expands the ontology to address previously implicit assumptions
- Introduces clearer language around observation and representation
- Begins to surface tensions around authority, agency, and completeness
- Demonstrates the need for more explicit architectural boundaries

However, these advancements remain exploratory rather than definitive.

------

## Known Limitations (Accepted for Pre-Alpha)

- Ontological constraints are still emergent
- Terminology continues to shift between drafts
- No explicit non-promises are yet formalized
- No stable narrative abstraction (e.g., Abstract or Architecture documents)
- No defined release or contribution discipline

------

## Compatibility Notes

- This version is **not guaranteed compatible** with Pre-Alpha 1 or later drafts
- Concepts may be redefined, renamed, or discarded in future versions
- This version should be treated as an immutable historical snapshot

------

## Closing Note

Pre-Alpha 2 marks the point at which The System begins to **push back against its own assumptions**.

It exposes the need for clearer articulation of limits, authority, and intent—needs that directly motivate the structural documentation introduced in subsequent versions.
