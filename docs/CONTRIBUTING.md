# CONTRIBUTING.md

## Contributing to The System

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

This project is an **ontological framework**, not a conventional software library. Contribution patterns, expectations, and timelines reflect that reality.

Most meaningful activity around this project is expected to occur **outside** the core repository, in the form of implementations, adapters, experiments, and derivative interpretations.

---

## Project Nature and Scope

The System defines:

* Ontological structures
* Conceptual rules
* Constraints on interpretation
* Philosophical and architectural invariants

It does **not** prescribe:

* Programming languages
* Runtime architectures
* Deployment models
* Implementation strategies

As a result:

* The core repository evolves slowly
* Changes are deliberate and infrequent
* Stability of meaning is prioritized over feature velocity

---

## License Context (Important)

This project is licensed under **GPLv3**.

Key clarifications of intent:

* **Implementing the ontology does not create a derivative work**
* **Using the framework as a reference does not trigger copyleft**
* **Only modifications or redistributions of the framework itself do**

You are free to:

* Build closed-source or commercial implementations
* Experiment privately without publishing changes
* Publish adapters or extensions separately

If you modify and distribute the framework itself, those changes must remain GPLv3.

This distinction is intentional and fundamental to the project.

---

## Preferred Contribution Paths

### 1. Issues (Strongly Encouraged)

Issues are the primary collaboration mechanism.

Appropriate uses include:

* Conceptual questions
* Clarification requests
* Ontological edge cases
* Detected ambiguities or contradictions
* Proposals for future consideration

Issues are **not commitments** to change.

---

### 2. Forks (Welcome and Expected)

Forks are **explicitly encouraged**.

You may fork to:

* Explore alternative interpretations
* Test divergent ontological models
* Maintain private or internal variants
* Publish your own downstream framework

Forking is considered a success case, not fragmentation.

---

### 3. Adapter Modules (Preferred for Extensions)

If your work requires the framework to behave differently:

* Publish an **adapter or extension** as a separate project
* License that adapter under **GPLv3**
* Keep proprietary implementations on the far side of a clean boundary

Adapters are the preferred mechanism for evolution without destabilizing the core ontology.

---

### 4. Pull Requests to This Repository (Rare)

Direct pull requests are expected to be **uncommon**, especially in early phases.

Reasons include:

* The project is pre-alpha and snapshot-driven
* Ontological changes have wide implications
* Architectural stability is more important than iteration speed

Pull requests that *are* appropriate:

* Corrections of internal inconsistency
* Clarifications that reduce ambiguity
* Documentation improvements aligned with stated intent
* Changes explicitly requested by the maintainer

Unsolicited architectural rewrites are unlikely to be accepted.

---

## Versioning and Contribution Timing

Contributors should understand the versioning model before proposing changes.

Key implications:

* **Pre-Alpha versions are immutable snapshots**
* Changes are not applied retroactively
* Contributions target *future drafts*, not existing tags
* Version numbers are set only during release preparation

Do **not** modify version identifiers unless explicitly instructed.

---

## Releases and Expectations

Pre-Alpha versions:

* May or may not be formally released
* Represent complete drafts for their scope
* Exist primarily as reference points

A contribution being accepted does **not** imply:

* Immediate inclusion in a release
* A timeline commitment
* Forward compatibility guarantees

Releases are communication artifacts, not acknowledgments of contribution volume.

---

## Governance and Authority

This project currently has a **single architectural authority**.

That authority is responsible for:

* Ontological coherence
* Version boundaries
* Release readiness
* Interpretive consistency

This may evolve in the future, but should not be assumed.

---

## Summary

You are encouraged to:

* Ask questions
* Fork freely
* Build adapters
* Implement independently
* Disagree constructively

You should not expect:

* Rapid merge cycles
* Broad consensus-driven design
* Code-centric contribution norms
* Immediate acceptance of deep structural changes

This project values **clarity, intent, and durability** over speed.

If that aligns with how you work, your participation is welcome.
